There should be an empty newline after this line, but before the Mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
%% See https://mermaidjs.github.io/sequenceDiagram.html

loop everyday D-2 working days 16:00
    ABCD->>DEE: [14:25] BEE (Calculation per TC until ACK becomes OK)
    
    ABCD->>FGG: BEE (Calculation per TC until ACK becomes OK)
    Note over ABCD,FGG: D-2 weekdays at 14:25
    ABCD->>HII: Projected Authorisations to HII
    Note over ABCD,HII: D-2 weekdays at 16:00
end

loop D-1 before deadline at 7:45
    HII->>DEE: Submission
    Note over HII,DEE: D-1 before deadline
    HII->>FGG: Submission
    Note over HII,FGG: D-1 before deadline
end
```

8. Should still find mermaid code even when code-block is indented.

    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram
        accTitle: State diagram example with \"double-quotes"
        accDescr: State diagram describing movement states and containing [] square brackets and \[]

        state Choose <<fork>>
        [*] --> Still
        Still --> [*]

        Still --> Moving
        Moving --> Choose
        Choose --> Still
        Choose --> Crash
        Crash --> [*]
    ```

9. Should still find mermaid code even with trailing spaces after the opening
`` ```mermaid `` and closing `` ``` ``.

```mermaid     
%%        ↑↑↑↑↑ spaces should be above here.
stateDiagram
    state Choose <<fork>>
    [*] --> Still
    Still --> [*]

    Still --> Moving
    Moving --> Choose
    Choose --> Still
    Choose --> Crash
    Crash --> [*]
%% ↓↓↓ should still find mermaid code even with trailing spaces after the ```
```   

**Warning**: do not delete the trailing spaces after the \`\`\`
