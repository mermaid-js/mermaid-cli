# Uploads created PR artifacts to percy
#
# Uploading to percy requires access to our secret PERCY_TOKEN environment
# variable.
# However, PRs from forks do not normally have access to GitHub Actions secrets
# as otherwise, they could just add an `echo "TOKEN"` to their PR to view the secret.
#
# Instead, we create a separate workflow_run action that runs after PRs without
# looking at any PR code, that then uploads to percy.
# This follows GitHub's recommended security guide,
# see https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
