# mermaid-cli

This is a command-line interface (CLI) for [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/). It takes a mermaid definition file as input and generates an svg/png/pdf file as output.

## Example Usage

Locate how to call the mmdc executable for your preferred method i.e. Docker,
Yarn, NPM, global install, etc. Try these examples to get started quickly.

### Convert Mermaid mmd Diagram File To SVG

```sh
mmdc -i input.mmd -o output.svg
```

### Create A PNG With A Dark Theme And Transparent Background

```sh
mmdc -i input.mmd -o output.png -t dark -b transparent
```

### Animating an SVG file with custom CSS

The `--cssFile` option can be used to inline some custom CSS.

Please see [./test-positive/flowchart1.css](test-positive/flowchart1.css) for an example of a CSS file that has animations.

**Warning**: If you want to override `mermaid`'s [`themeCSS`](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/Setup?id=theme), we recommend instead adding `{"themeCSS": "..."})` to your mermaid `--configFile`. You may also need to use [`!important`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/important) to override mermiad's `themeCSS`.

**Warning**: Inline CSS files may be blocked by your browser, depending on the [HTTP Content-Security-Policy header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) of the website that hosts your SVG.

```sh
mmdc --input test-positive/flowchart1.mmd --cssFile test-positive/flowchart1.css -o docs/animated-flowchart.svg
```

### Transform a markdown file with mermaid diagrams

```sh
mmdc -i readme.template.md -o readme.md
```

This command transforms a markdown file itself. The mermaid-cli will find the mermaid diagrams, create SVG files from them and refer to those in the markdown output.

This:

~~~md
### Some markdown
```mermaid
graph
   [....]
```

### Some more markdown
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   [....]
```

### Mermaid with custom title/desc
```mermaid
graph
   accTitle: My title here
   accDescr: My description here
   A-->B
```
~~~

Becomes:

```md
### Some markdown
![diagram](./readme-1.svg)

### Some more markdown
![diagram](./readme-2.svg)

### Mermaid with custom title/desc
![My description here](./readme-3.svg "My title here")
```

### Piping from stdin

You can easily pipe input from stdin. This example shows how to use a heredoc to
send a diagram as stdin to mermaid-cli (mmdc).

```sh
cat << EOF  | mmdc
    graph TD
    A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
EOF
```

### See All Available Options

```sh
mmdc -h
```

## Use Docker:

```sh
docker pull minlag/mermaid-cli
```

or pull from Github Container Registry

```sh 
docker pull ghcr.io/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli/mermaid-cli
```

or e.g. version 8.8.0

```sh
docker pull minlag/mermaid-cli:8.8.0
```

The container looks for input files in `/data`. So for example, if you have a
diagram defined on your system in `/path/to/diagrams/diagram.mmd`, you can use
the container to generate an SVG file as follows:

```sh
docker run -it -v /path/to/diagrams:/data minlag/mermaid-cli -i /data/diagram.mmd
```

## Use Node.JS API

It's possible to call `mermaid-cli` via a Node.JS API.
Please be aware that **the NodeJS API is not covered by semver**, as `mermaid-cli` follows
`mermaid`'s versioning.

```js
import { run } from "@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli"

await run(
   "input.mmd", "output.svg", // {optional options},
)
```

## Install locally

Some people are [having issues](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli/issues/15)
installing this tool globally. Installing it locally is an alternative solution:

```
yarn add @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
./node_modules/.bin/mmdc -h
```

Or use NPM:

```
npm install @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
./node_modules/.bin/mmdc -h
```

## Install globally

❗️ We do **NOT** recommend installing it globally because both YARN and NPM
could fail to install a command-line tool globally properly due to weird
permission issues.
`yarn global add @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` or `npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`

## Install with [brew](https://brew.sh)
This method of installation is no longer supported.
For more details, see the [discussion](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli/issues/288).
An old version of mermaid-cli can be installed with brew.
```
brew install mermaid-cli
```

### Run with npx

[`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) is installed by default with NPM. It
downloads and runs commands at the same time.  To use Mermaid CLI with npx, you
need to use the `-p` flag because the package name is different than the command
it installs (`mmdc`).  `npx -p @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli mmdc -h`
